title: Introduction to the Backend Guide
description: Overview of the backend architecture, technologies, and guide structure for the Toy Store Management App.
---

Welcome to the backend documentation for the Toy Store Management App. This guide will walk you through the server-side architecture, including how we:

- Use **Node.js** and **Express** to build a RESTful API
- Leverage **Xata**, a managed PostgreSQL-as-a-Service, for data storage
- Implement authentication, authorization, and validation via middleware
- Structure routes and controllers for maintainability
- Handle errors with custom `ExpressError` classes and a global error handler
- Organize services and controllers to interact cleanly with our database
- Generate reports and analytics endpoints for business insights
- Write unit and integration tests to ensure reliability

By following these pages, youâ€™ll gain a deep understanding of our design choices and middleware patterns.

## Purpose & Audience

This guide is aimed at backend developers who will build, extend, or maintain the Toy Store API. You should be familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript and basic REST principles.

## How to Use This Guide

1. **02-Setup**  
   Get the project running locally: install dependencies, configure environment variables, and start the server.

2. **03-Database Architecture**  
   Learn how we define schemas in Xata and initialize the client.

3. **04-Authentication and Middleware**  
   Understand how JWTs, route protection, and request validation are implemented.

4. **05-Routing Structure**  
   Explore how routes are organized and mounted under `/api`.

5. **06-Error Handling**  
   See our custom error classes and global error handler in action.

6. **07-Validation**  
   Discover how input is validated and sanitized before reaching controllers.

7. **08-Reporting and Analytics**  
   Review endpoints that aggregate data and generate PDF reports.

## Next Steps

Proceed to **Setup** to install and configure the backend, then follow along in order to build a complete picture of our server-side architecture.
